# java-fundamentals

Java: java is a high level object oriented programming laguage which was devoloped the sun microsystem and now is managed by Oracle.

Features of java:

1) simple : As we know java is high level language so it is easy to understand by humans ,because it uses english words as keywords like if ,else ,while ,for etc . And unlike c++ it does have the concept of pointer so it is easy for most of the programers to code in java .

2) Object-Oriented : As i mentioned above that java is object oriented laguage by that I mean to say that java has all the four main properties of Object oriented programing i.e. Encasulation, Inheritence , Abstraction and polymorphism.

3) Platform Indepent : Java is based on the principle of WORA (write once run anywhere) that means you have to write code on one operating system and get the byte code by compiling the java code and that byte code is platform independent and that byte code can run on any operating system which has JVM installed on it.

4) Secure : java is a secure programming language as it has various features such as byte code verification which run verification on the bytecode and it also have a set of api's for encryption and secure communication by all this it ensure that there is no unauthorized access and security threats.

5) Robust : Java has a good memory managment system by that i mean to say that if there any memory location which is being occupied but there is no reference to that memory in that case Garbage collection comes into the picture and it frees up the memory automaticly . And in java there is also concept of exeption handling in which we can execute further if error is occured in our code by wrapping our error prone code in try catch block.

6) High Performance : java is a high performance language it has JIT(just in Time ) compilation which convert the byte code to machine level code at the run time which makes java a high performance language.

7) Portable :  java is a platform independent language and hence its byte code can run on any operating system , So all we have to do is get the byte code by compiling the java code on any operating system and now we can run that byte code on any operating system which has JVM installed on it and hence by that we can say that java is a portable language.

8) Rich in Libraries : Java provides a comprehensive standard library that includes APIs for data structures, networking, input/output, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and more, simplifying development.

9) Interpreted and Compiled : java is a hybrid language that it  uses both compilation and interpretation to run your code ,firstly it compiles your code to byte code and then byte code is interpreted.

10) Multithreaded : java also possess the feature of multi threading which is very useful for high performance applications like web servers , games etc.
