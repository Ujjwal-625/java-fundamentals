Java: java is a high level object oriented programming laguage which was devoloped the sun microsystem and now is managed by Oracle.

Features of java:

1) simple : As we know java is high level language so it is easy to understand by humans ,because it uses english words as keywords like if ,else ,while ,for etc . And unlike c++ it does have the concept of pointer so it is easy for most of the programers to code in java .

2) Object-Oriented : As i mentioned above that java is object oriented laguage by that I mean to say that java has all the four main properties of Object oriented programing i.e. Encasulation, Inheritence , Abstraction and polymorphism.

3) Platform Indepent : Java is based on the principle of WORA (write once run anywhere) that means you have to write code on one operating system and get the byte code by compiling the java code and that byte code is platform independent and that byte code can run on any operating system which has JVM installed on it.

4) Secure : java is a secure programming language as it has various features such as byte code verification which run verification on the bytecode and it also have a set of api's for encryption and secure communication by all this it ensure that there is no unauthorized access and security threats.

5) Robust : Java has a good memory managment system by that i mean to say that if there any memory location which is being occupied but there is no reference to that memory in that case Garbage collection comes into the picture and it frees up the memory automaticly . And in java there is also concept of exeption handling in which we can execute further if error is occured in our code by wrapping our error prone code in try catch block.
